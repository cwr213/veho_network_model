"""
Network Structure Generation Module

Builds OD (origin-destination) matrices and generates candidate paths for optimization.
Enforces business rules around facility types and routing constraints.

Key Business Rules:
- Only hub/hybrid facilities can originate middle-mile flows
- Launch facilities only receive direct injection (never send outbound)
- Secondary hubs must route outbound through parent hub
- Launch facilities require parent hub as second-to-last stop
- No circular routing allowed (facility cannot appear twice in path)
